# TinyC Compiler
The front end of the tinyC compiler, which includes a lexer and a parser.
It was completed by GNUWin Flex and Bison.
The manually coding part are scanner.l, parser.y and pysim.py which is a script to simulate the running of Pcode--intermediate code of the compiler. And the makefile is used to control the compilation and linking of the project.
